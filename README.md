### Current Functionality

  - a
- Market
  - Button to get float and screenshot of item
  - Button to do that for all items on page
  - Buttons to load 10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page
- Tradeoffer
  - Button to stack keys, cases, and graffiti
  - Option to easily add multiple items to trade at once
  - Link to screenshot of each item (screenshot includes info about item)

### Common Errors
- Please try reloading the page a few times if the extension isn't working. For some reason that fixes things sometimes.

##### Todo
- fix tradeoffer search being broken (add all keys to trade then remove them and try searching 'key' again)
- add data stashing for the market so floats will stay with listings until page is reloaded
- add floats within page
- load inventory differently with JSON
