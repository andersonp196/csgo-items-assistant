### Common Errors
- Please try reloading the page a few times if the extension isn't working. For some reason that fixes things sometimes.

##### Todo
- Doppler phases in inventory and tradeoffer (market?)
- icon if item isn't tradable in inventory
- add link to market items on item (including ST and souveneir) in inventory
- change border around items if they are ST or souveneir (inventory and tradeoffer)
- fix tradeoffer search being broken (add all keys to trade then remove them and try searching 'key' again)
- add data stashing for the market so floats will stay with listings until page is reloaded
- add option to select currency
