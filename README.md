### Common Errors
- Please try reloading the page a few times if the extension isn't working. For some reason that fixes things sometimes.

##### Todo

- add screenshot links within trades
- add floats within page
- fix adding x items when there are stacked keys in inventory
- load inventory differently with JSON
